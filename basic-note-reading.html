				<h2>Reading Treble Clef and Bass Clef</h2>
				<p>The <u>musical staff</u> consists of five lines and four spaces.</p>
				<img src="images/staff.jpg" alt="Music Staff" />
				<p>We use the <u>staff</u> to organize musical pitches from low to high. In scientific terms, each line
					and space is assigned a discrete pitch frequency within the context of a musical scale; but in
					essence, all you need to remember is this: <br> <strong>when notes move <u>up</u> the staff, they
						sound <u>higher</u>; when notes move <u>down</u> the staff, they sound <u>lower</u>.</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>Treble Clef</h3>
				<p>We use the <u>Treble Clef</u> to write a higher note range. As a point of reference, we may observe
					how the curl of the Treble Clef curves around the second line of the staff. Notes on this line are
					called "G."
					<br>Treble Clef is used by soprano and alto (sometimes tenor) singers, violin, flute, etc.</p>
				<img src="images/treble-clef-g.jpg" alt="Treble Clef" />
				<h3>Bass Clef</h3>
				<p>We use the <u>Bass Clef</u> to write a lower note range. As a point of reference, we may observe how
					the shape of the Bass Clef highlights the fourth line of the staff. Notes on this line are called
					"F."
					<br>Bass Clef is used by bass singers, cello, string bass, tuba, etc.</p>
				<img src="images/bass-clef-f.jpg" alt="Bass Clef" />
				<h3>C Clef</h3>
				<p>Some musicians (totally not weirdos at all) use <u>C Clef</u> to write a middle note range which
					would be inconvenient to write using the other clefs. As a point of reference, we may observe that
					the center of the C Clef shape designates a line as <u>Middle C.</u> The C Clef may be moved to
					place <u>Middle C</u> on any line.
					<br>C Clef is used by viola (called "Alto Clef"), cello (called "Tenor Clef"), bassoon, etc.</p>
				<img src="images/alto-clef.jpg" alt="Alto Clef" />
				<p>When the C Clef places Middle C on the middle line of the staff, it is commonly called <u>"Alto
						Clef."</u></p>
				<h3>Grand Staff</h3>
				<p>Middle C may be written in Treble or Bass Clef by using a <u>leger line</u>. Leger lines may be used
					to write notes above or below the range of the staff.</p>
				<img src="images/grand-staff-middle-c.jpg" alt="Grand Staff" />
				<p><strong>Middle C is exactly in between (in the <u>middle</u> of) Treble Clef and Bass Clef.</strong>
					<br>Note: There are other mnemonic devices to remember the note names of the lines and spaces. I
					prefer to use only three landmark notes (in red) and practice counting up or down the staff. This
					process better leads to fluency, as other mnemonics may become crutches if overused.

			<!-- The Musical Alphabet, Staff & Keyboad -->
			<section>
				<h3>The Musical Alphabet</h3>
				<p>We differentiate pitches by using the letters:
					<br><b>A - B - C - D - E - F - G</b>
					<br>As seen in the Grand Staff above, ascending notes go in alphabetical order.
				</p>
				<p>On the piano keyboard, going in ascending alphabetical order means moving to the right. Modifiers
					called <u>"Accidentals"</u> allow us to use the black notes, but the Musical Alphabet may generally
					be thought of as referring just to the white notes.
					<br><img src="images/piano-keyboard.jpg" alt="Piano Keyboard" />
					<br>Note: The Musical Alphabet repeats itself up and down the range of the keyboard and the music
					staff.
				</p>
				<h3>Steps and Skips</h3>
				<p><u>On the Staff</u>
					<br>When moving in alphabetical order on the staff, notice that notes are placed on alternating
					lines and spaces. Moving from one note to another in this manner (line-space-line-space) is moving
					by <u>"step."</u>
					<br>When moving from a line note to the next line note (or from a space note to the next space
					note), notice that one note will be passed over. Moving in this way (line-line or space-space) is
					moving by <u>"skip."</u></p>
				<p><u>On the Piano Keyboard</u>
					<br>The piano keyboard is a helpful visual to further differentiate between <u>half-steps</u> and
					<u>whole-steps</u>.
					<br><u><b>Half-steps</b></u> move from one piano key (black or white) to the next (black or white).
					<br><u><b>Whole-steps</b></u> are simply two consecutive half-steps. A whole step on the keyboard
					will have one single key between the two notes (there is one black key between C and D).</p>
				<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong>
					<br>Observe on the piano keyboard that B-C and E-F are the only places where there are two white
					notes a half-step apart. These are the only all-white-note half-steps. While this is plain to see on
					the piano keyboard, this important point is not shown on the staff.</p>

			<!-- Accidentals -->
			<section>
				<h3>Accidentals - sharps, flats, naturals</h3>
				<p><u>Accidentals</u> are symbols used to modify the notes of the Musical Alphabet by raising or
					lowering by a half-step or a whole-step.</p>
				<ul class="accidentals">
					<li>Sharp - Raises by a half-step
						<br><img src="images/accidentals/f-sharp-keyboard.jpg" alt="Sharp" class="small-piano" /></li>
					<li>Flat - Lowers by a half-step
						<br><img src="images/accidentals/b-flat-keyboard.jpg" alt="Flap" class="small-piano" /></li>
					<li>Natural Sign - negates any prior accidental
						<br>On the piano keyboard, the natural sign usually means to play on the white notes.</li>
					<li>Double Sharp - Raises by a whole-step
						<br><img src="images/accidentals/g-double-sharp-keyboard.jpg" alt="Double Sharp"
							class="small-piano" /></li>
					<li>Double Flat - Lowers by a whole-step
						<br><img src="images/accidentals/g-double-flat-keyboard.jpg" alt="Double Flat"
							class="small-piano" /></li>
